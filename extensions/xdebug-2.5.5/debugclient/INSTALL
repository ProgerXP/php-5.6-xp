INSTALLATION
============

Compilation of the debug client can be done very easily with the following
three steps:

1. ./buildconf
2. ./configure 
   or
   ./configure --with-libedit
   in case you have libedit installed. This is highly recommended as it makes
   navigating to previous commands much easier.
3. make 
4. make install
