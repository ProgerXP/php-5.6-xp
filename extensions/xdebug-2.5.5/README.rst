Xdebug
------

These are instructions for installing Xdebug. Please also refer to
http://xdebug.org/support.php for support.

You need to compile Xdebug separately from the rest of PHP.  Note, however,
that you need access to the scripts ``phpize`` and ``php-config``.  If your
system does not have ``phpize`` and ``php-config``, you will need to compile
and install PHP from a source tarball first, as these script are
by-products of the PHP compilation and installation processes. It is
important that the source version matches the installed version as there
are slight, but important, differences between PHP versions. 

Once you have access to ``phpize`` and ``php-config``, do the following:

1. Unpack the tarball: ``tar -xzf xdebug-2.4.x.tgz``.  Note that you do
   not need to unpack the tarball inside the PHP source code tree. Xdebug is
   compiled separately, all by itself, as stated above.

2. ``cd xdebug-2.4.x``

3. Run phpize: ``phpize``
   (or ``/path/to/phpize`` if phpize is not in your path).

4. ``./configure --enable-xdebug`` (or: ``../configure --enable-xdebug
   --with-php-config=/path/to/php-config`` if ``php-config`` is not in your
   path)

5. Run: ``make``

6. ``cp modules/xdebug.so /to/wherever/you/want/it``

7. add the following line to ``php.ini``:
   ``zend_extension="/wherever/you/put/it/xdebug.so"``

8. Restart your webserver.

9. Write a PHP page that calls ``phpinfo();``. Load it in a browser and
   look for the info on the xdebug module.  If you see it, you have been
   successful!
